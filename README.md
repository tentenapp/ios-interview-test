# ios-interview-test

The project is deliberately unfinished. 
There is a number of `TODO` and `FIXME` throughout the code that you must implement or fix.

## Important notes

- Please, do not fork your solution in a public repository
- You must **not** change the content of `ios-interview-test/`
- This test is designed to challenge your knowledge of the Swift ecosystem, Swift itself and SwiftUI
- Feel free to add any amount of testing, ...etc
- The test shouldn't take you more than a day.
