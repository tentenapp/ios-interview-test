There is a number of `TODO` and `FIXME` throughout the code that you must implement or fix.

## What should I do?

There are a few tasks to perform:

- Test your animation skills by implementing a custom `ConnectionIndicator`
- Test your `async` / `await` skills by implementing an `ExecutionQueue`
- Test your Swift & SwiftUI knowledge by implementing a set of small – but tricky, components
- Implement a high performance friendlist
- Implement a commonly found 'Settings' page, following a Figma design

## Important notes

- Please, do not fork your solution in a public repository
- You must **not** change the content of `ios-interview-test/`
- This test is designed to challenge your knowledge of the Swift ecosystem, Swift itself and SwiftUI
- Feel free to add any amount of testing, ...etc
- It's okay if you don't do it all !
