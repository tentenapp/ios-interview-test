/// **TODO:** This is a bonus assignment. It's okay if you don't do this.
/// You need to implement a `GrowingVStack`, which acts like a standard `VStack` but
/// applies a `.scaleEffect(1.00 + (0.15 * CGFloat(ndx)))` to each child view.
///
/// The expected solution requires you to have a deep understanding of how SwiftUI is implemented.
